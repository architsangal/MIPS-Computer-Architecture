# MIPS-Computer-Architecture

This is MIPS assembly program to read N numbers stored in consecutive memory locations (like stored in hard disk internally). Then these numbers are sorted in ascending order and stored in a different set of memory locations. Also you can give the  starting memory address as input where you need to store the output sorted numbers.

We used MARS for the running the code (if you are not able to run MARS - shows an error then -> GO TO PROPERTIES -> check the box next to "Allow to run as program").
